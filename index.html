            <p>Archaeology Collections Assistant</p>
            <p>April 2011 to May 2016</p>
            <p>My duties varied from any one given day including processing
              outgoing object loans to moving a 1,000 year old boat to guiding
              a visiting researcher through the proper digitization of
              photograph negatives. </p>
            <p>Projects I head include the start to finish removal, inventory,
              and museum-quality packing of objects to the processing of
              condition reports upon their return. Database work is an important
               part of my collections work, where I describe and record not only
                object information, but also attach images and related
                publications, and generate of collections reports.</p>
            <p>Another aspect of my work in the Archaeology Department is the
              processing of archives and the digitization of negatives,
              photographs, and slides from past and recent archaeological
              excavations. I create digital photograph finders, organize digital
               archives, and preform records management preservation tasks
               related to the collection's archival records. </p>
