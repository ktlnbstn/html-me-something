                <div>LaunchCode is a non-profit organization that aims to
                  teach tech skills to young workers.</div>
                <div>I am currently enrolled in the LaunchCode 101 course. This
                  course is a 20-week program that will conclude in August 2017.
                   The LC101 course provides a motivating environment and
                   mentors to guide students through specialized programming
                   tracks to prepare them for tech jobs.</div>
                <div>LC101 is meant to prepare students for the Apprenticeship
                  program. This program matches self-taught programmers with
                  companies that are interested in further guiding the students'
                   learning opportunites to prepare them for full-time employment.</div>

            <div>Loan or Buy?</div>
            <div>How many times have you gotten a great book recommendation and
              hunted it down immediately? First you head to your local library's
               website, then you move on to Amazon, well maybe it's on
               IndieBooks...</div>
            <div>Loan or Buy? simplifies this silly problem. My website connects
              your local library database with those popular online booksellers
              you have come to rely on when your hold position at 543 just isn't
               fast enough for that hottest tech book.</div>
            <div>Place a hold if you're not in a hurry or PrimeNow yourself a used
               copy to your doorstep. Either way, save yourself more than a few
               clicks.</div>

            <div>Archaeology Collections Assistant</div>
            <div>April 2011 to May 2016</div>
            <div>My duties varied from any one given day including processing
              outgoing object loans to moving a 1,000 year old boat to guiding
              a visiting researcher through the proper digitization of
              photograph negatives. </div>
            <div>Projects I head include the start to finish removal, inventory,
              and museum-quality packing of objects to the processing of
              condition reports upon their return. Database work is an important
               part of my collections work, where I describe and record not only
                object information, but also attach images and related
                publications, and generate of collections reports.</div>
            <div>Another aspect of my work in the Archaeology Department is the
              processing of archives and the digitization of negatives,
              photographs, and slides from past and recent archaeological
              excavations. I create digital photograph finders, organize digital
               archives, and preform records management preservation tasks
               related to the collection's archival records. </div>
